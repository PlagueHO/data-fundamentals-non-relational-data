## Running the tutorials

To run through each tutorial, you will need an Azure subscription. If you don't have one, you can create a free account [here](https://aka.ms/azurefree).

> Important: These tutorials assume foundational Azure knowledge and how to use the Azure Portal. If you are new to Azure, you can learn more about it [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/azure/).

Most of the code is written in Python, but there is also some PowerShell. Being able to read/write these languages is not essential and you should still be able to understand the gist.

You can run the code in your local environment or in a GitHub Codespaces environment.

You should open this repository in GitHub Codespaces. If you are not already in GitHub Codespaces, you can open it by clicking on the `Code` button and selecting `Open with Codespaces`.

Each tutorial is in a separate Jupyter notebook in the [tutorials](/tutorials) folder. You can open each notebook and run the code cells to follow along with the tutorial.

- [03 - Azure Files](/tutorials/03-azure-files.ipynb)
- [04 - Azure Table Storage](/tutorials/04-azure-table-storage.ipynb)
- [05 - AzCopy & Azure Storage Explorer](/tutorials/05-azcopy-azure-storage-explorer.ipynb)
- [06 - Azure Cosmos DB](/tutorials/06-azure-cosmos-db.ipynb)

## Conclusion

In this session, we looked at how to work with non-relational data in Azure. We created Azure Blob Storage, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Table Storage, and Azure Data Lake Storage accounts and performed various operations on them.
